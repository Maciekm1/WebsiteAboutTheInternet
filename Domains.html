<h1>Domains/DNS</h1>
<br><br>
<p>A domain is a logical grouping of computers. The computers in a domain can share physical proximity on a small LAN or they can be located in different parts of the world.</p>
<br>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name Server<br>At its most basic, DNS is a directory of names that match with numbers. The numbers, in this case are IP addresses, which computers use to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Like the internet itself, the DNS directory is distributed around the world, stored on domain name servers that all communicate with each other on a very regular basis to provide updates and redundancies.Each domain can correspond to more than one IP address. In fact, some sites have hundreds or more IP addresses that correspond with a single domain name. For example, the server your computer reaches for www.google.com is likely completely different from the server that someone in another country would reach by typing the same site name into their browser.
Another reason for the distributed nature of the directory is the amount of time it would take for you to get a response when you were looking for a site if there was only one location for the directory, shared among the millions, probably billions, of people also looking for information at the same time. Thatâ€™s one long line to use the phone book.</p>
