<h1>How the Internet Works</h1>
<br>
<h3>What is it and Physical Structure</h3>
<p>The internet is a global network of interconnencted networks that communicate using a common 
set of standards and protocols. These networks are owned and managed by a wide range of 
organisations, such as national governments, private companies, and academic institutions.

The devices they use are connected (either wirelessly or by cable) to high speed telecommunication 
networks that span the globe. At the heart of these networks is the internet backbone: 
a mesh of super fast fibre-optic cables and industrial routers that move data at an eye-watering 
speed. Most of the backbone is provided by giant telecommunication companies</p>
<br>
<p>A regional Internet registry (RIR) is an organization that manages the allocation and 
registration of Internet number resources within a region of the world. Internet number 
resources include IP addresses and autonomous system (AS) numbers.
The regional Internet registry system evolved over time, eventually dividing the 
responsibility for management to a registry for each of five regions of the world.</p>

<h4>Registrar and Registry</h4>
<p>What is the difference between a registrar and a registry?
Registries are organizations that manage top-level domains (TLDs) ‘.com’ and ‘.net’ — specifically 
by maintaining the records of which individual domains belong to which people and organizations. 
These registries are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) — a department of 
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a global organization that 
coordinates several processes and databases that support the Internet’s basic functionality.
Registries delegate the commercial sales of domain name registrations to registrars. 
For example, when a registrar sells a ‘.com’ domain registration to an end user 
(or ‘registrant’), the registrar must notify VeriSign — the registry for ‘.com’ domains. 
The registrar must also pay VeriSign a fee, which is factored into the price that the registrar 
charges the end user.</p>
