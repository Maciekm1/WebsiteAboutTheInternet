<h1>Topology</h1>
<p>There are different ways of setting up a LAN, 
each with different benefits in terms of network speed and cost. 
Three of the main topologies include bus, star and ring.</p><br>
<h3>Bus network</h3>
<p>In a bus network all the workstations, servers and printers are joined to one cable - 
'the bus'. At each end of the cable a terminator is fitted to stop signals reflecting back 
down the bus.</p>

<h3>Ring network</h3>
<p>In a ring network, each device (eg workstation, server, printer) 
is connected in a ring so each one is connected to two other devices. 
Each data packet on the network travels in one direction. 
Each device receives each packet in turn until the destination device receives it.</p>

<h3>Star network</h3>
<p>In a star network, each device on the network has its own cable that connects to 
a switch or hub. This is the most popular way of setting up a LAN. You may find a 
star network in a small network of five or six computers where speed is a priority.</p>

<h3>Mesh network</h3>
<p>A mesh topology is a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected 
with one another. This topology setup allows for most transmissions to be distributed even if one 
of the connections goes down. It is a topology commonly used for wireless networks.<p/>
